# GPT INSTRUCTIONS

Any AI making changes to this project must follow these instructions

## Change Tracking

The CHANGELOG.md file must be kept up to date with every change. Log what you were asked to change, and the changes you made to fulfill that request.

If you are diagnosing an issue, include what issue you are attempt to resolve and the steps you took to resolve it. Use these details in the future to remember what you have tried in the past.

## Logging

Use the console.log to validate your assumptions. For example, if it is unclear if a dom change was successful, log the before and after. Ask me to provide the details of the log if it is helpful in diagnosing an issue.

## README.md

Keep the readme updated every change to the application.
